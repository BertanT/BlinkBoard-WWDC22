                    The keyboard features an intuitive QWERTY-based layout optimized for BlinkBoard so you can find\

                    The keyboard will continuously skim through each row by highlighting them at an interval. Blink\
                     when the row containing your key gets highlighted to select it. The row will split into sections,\
                     and now the keyboard will skim through those. Blink again when the segment containing your key\
                     gets highlighted - the keyboard will scan through each key inside. Finally, blink when your\
                     character gets highlighted to type!

                    As you type, BlinkBoard will predict the word you want to write and show suggestions next to the\
                     text field. Use the \(Image(systemName: "wand.and.stars")) key to select one of them and speed up\
                     your typing process.

                    Action keys like \(Image(systemName: "wand.and.stars")) are located directly inside the rows so\
                     that you can access them quickly. Additionally, you can long blink for 1s to go back to the\
                     start if you make a mistake, while long-blinking at the top level will pause the keyboard when\
                     you need a break.
