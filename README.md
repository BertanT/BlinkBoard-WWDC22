# BlinkBoard - WWDC22 Swift Student Challenge Submission
## 👀 Overview
###  Submission Status: Waiting for results.
My playground for the WWDC22 Swift Student Challenge! Inspired by how Professor Stephen Hawking used to type on his wheelchair computer and talk, BlinkBoard aims to improve and make the technology accessible to more people who need it by bringing it to a widespread and relatively affordable device: the iPad. 

As it's name suggests, you operate BlinkBoard by blinking with your eyes instead of moving your cheek as Professor Hawking did. This is achived by using the Vision framework and calculating the user's eye aspect ratio in order to detect blinks. The app has detailed usage instuction on the onboarding screen, and descriptive line comments in the soruce code. So feel free to try it out yourself, tweak the code, and reach out to me with any questions! 😁
